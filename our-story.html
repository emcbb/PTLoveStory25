                <h2>How We Met</h2>
                <p>We first crossed paths on boxing day of 2023 at a mutual family friend’s home. We had a few chats here and there, but nothing major. In the evening of the same day, we were sent on an errand together, where we had a nice conversation alone but still nothing serious. Fast forward to a random afternoon in August 2024 where I received a WhatsApp message from Otimeyin. What started as a random texting, quickly grew to constant calls and something special. As we got to know each other more, we realized how much we wanted to each other’s lives permanently. That random WhatsApp message blossomed into a beautiful love story, and we are ready to begin our forever.</p>

            <h2>Our Proposal</h2>
            <h3>Her Point of View</h3>
            <p>It was simple, intimate, and well thought out. What I thought would be just a birthday dinner, turned into one of the best and most unforgettable birthdays of my life. We went on a birthday trip to Marrakech, which is one of my favourite holidays with my favourite person. On my Birthday, we had itineraries planned for the day, which included, Going to the famous museum, to a beach club to relax and have lunch, and then end the day with an intimate birthday dinner. After the lovely dinner, we got back to the hotel and voila, I see rose petals leading to my room , and as soon as I open the door , I see more rose petals on the floor and also used to write out ‘will you marry me’, a bunch of my favourite roses, a photographer and the hotel concierge all smiles at me. It felt Unreal. He got down on one knee and asked the question that changed everything. In that moment, it felt right, and with a heart full of joy, I said ‘YES’. I loved the fact it was how I had wanted to be proposed. An intentional man he is. This is a beautiful beginning to the journey we're now on together.</p>
            
            <h3>His Point of View</h3>
            <p>The day started out amazing with the one I had chosen to spend forever with. It was her birthday, a day already so special, but for me it carried even deeper meaning, it was the day I planned to ask her the most important question of my life. Beneath the calm exterior, I was nervous, hoping every detail I’d prepared would come together perfectly. I wanted this moment to be thoughtful, intentional, and unforgettable, just like her.
               We were on a trip to Marrakech, a beautiful city, an amazing hotel, and the perfect setting for everything I had envisioned. We had our day carefully planned: places to visit, rides to enjoy, breakfast, lunch, and dinner. But after dinner, I had something extraordinary planned. I had made all the preparations with the hotel management: a photographer, a bottle of beautiful wine, and rose petals arranged on both the floor and the bed.
               After our lovely dinner, I can still remember returning to the hotel and how my heartbeat sounded like an engine as she opened the door. She saw the trail of roses, the flashes from the photographer’s camera, and the warm smiles from the hotel staff. In that magical moment, I got down on one knee and asked her to be my wife. I was nervous until I heard her beautiful, soft voice say “YES.”
               That single word made me the happiest man that night. I appreciate her deeply and cannot wait to spend forever by her side. </p>
